I'm a master's student in mathematics at the City College of New York but I moonlight as a software engineer. In 2018, I completed an MA in philosophy from the University of Waterloo where I did my <a href="{{site.url}}/papers/Property-Thesis.pdf">thesis</a> on the nature and origins of psychological ownership.

Prior to Waterloo, I worked as a software engineer in NYC during the somewhat [chaotic]({{site.url}}/images/Moby-Dick-Grand-Elections.png) 2016 calendar year. To keep the tradition alive, I came back to work in the city in September 2019. I graduated from McGill University in June 2015 with a bachelor's in physics & computer science. To find out more, you can take a look at <a href="{{site.url}}/CV.pdf">my CV</a>.

 Apart from my formal academic interests, I sometimes write about the human condition.
