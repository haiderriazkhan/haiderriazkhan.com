A spectre is haunting America-- the spectre of pseudo journalism. I am not merely referring to the rapid dissemination of false information on social media (Facebook and Twitter in particular) that has become commonplace in recent times. Neither am I talking about the complex and vast conservative media network-- ranging from [talk radio](http://faculty.washington.edu/baldasty/radio.htm) and [youtube channels](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/04/one-reason-we-lose) to [cable programs](https://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/the-top-cable-news-programs-of-february-2018-are/358502). I am talking about the non-partisan privileging of American orthodoxy and power that is the standard practice of most mainstream American media. The adherence of the fourth estate to the imperialist viewpoint. The viewpoint that dehumanizes the people of the global south-- the same people that are often victims of American aggression and exploitation. Take for instance the coverage (or lack thereof) of the [American war against Nicaragua](https://chomsky.info/unclesam08/) by the New York Times.
