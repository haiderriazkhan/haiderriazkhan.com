I completed an MA in philosophy from the University of Waterloo in 2018. During my time in graduate school, I worked on two main research projects: (1) resolving problems in quantum foundations by utilizing quantum information theory in conjunction with the appropriate metaphysical structure (2) the nature and origin of human ownership and property.

Prior to Waterloo, I worked as a software engineer in NYC during the somewhat [chaotic](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/donald-trump-wins-us-election-news) 2016 calendar year. To keep the tradition alive, I came back to work in the city in September 2019. I graduated from [McGill University](http://www.mcgill.ca/about/) in June 2015 with a bachelor's in Physics & Computer Science. To learn more about my education and work history, take a look at <a href="{{site.url}}/CV.pdf">my CV</a>.

 Apart from philosophy and political theory, I have an interest in Pashto and Urdu Poetry, existentialist literature, and genres of music embedded in socio-political struggles.x
