I'm an MA student in the [philosophy department](https://uwaterloo.ca/philosophy/) at the University of Waterloo. My current research can be partitioned into three disparate topics: (1) resolving problems in quantum foundations by utilizing quantum information theory in conjunction with the appropriate metaphysical structure (2) the nature and origins of human ownership and property (3) viability of societies with decentralized workers' control of the means of production.

Prior to Waterloo, I worked as a software engineer in NYC at [Medidata](https://www.mdsol.com/en) during the somewhat [chaotic](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/donald-trump-wins-us-election-news) 2016-2017 calendar year. I graduated from [McGill University](http://www.mcgill.ca/about/) in June 2015 with a bachelor's in Physics & Computer Science. To learn more about my education and work history, take a look at <a href="{{ site.url }}/CV.pdf">my CV</a>.

 I have been living in Canada since 2007 and became a Canadian in 2012. My ancestral homeland is [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa](https://www.britannica.com/place/Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa), Pakistan. Apart from natural philosophy and political theory, I have an interest in Pashto and Urdu Poetry, existentialist literature, and genres of music embedded in socio-political struggles.
